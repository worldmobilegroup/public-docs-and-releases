There is a minimum setup, a slightly better one, and the recommended by the AyA 
development team.

## Minimum setup: 1 Validator
All EarthNode Operators must have one validator, with following 
specifications:
* Ubuntu 22.04 or higher
* Two cores or more
* At least 8 GB RAM
* At least 400 GB disk space

## Slightly improved setup: 1 Validator and 1 Sentry
Initially, we recommend the same specifications for both validators and sentries:
* Ubuntu 22.04 or higher
* Two cores or more
* At least 8 GB RAM
* At least 400 GB disk space

## Recommended setup: 1 Validator and 2 Sentries
For the best operation, 1 validator and 2 sentries are highly recommended, each with 
the following specifications:
* Ubuntu 22.04 or higher
* Two cores or more
* At least 8 GB RAM
* At least 400 GB disk space

{{<alert title="Note">}}More operating systems and distributions will be made available
in the future, and the hardware requirements will change.{{</alert>}}
