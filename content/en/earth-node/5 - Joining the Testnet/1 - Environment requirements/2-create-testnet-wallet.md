## Using Eternl extension
Currently, we recommend using Eternl for your Cardano Preview Testnet wallet. If you
haven't done so already, please, follow the official instructions on installing the
extension version of Eternl.

To create your Cardano Preview Testnet wallet, complete the following steps:
1. Open Eternl by clicking on the extension icon.
2. If you cannot see __Preview__ on the bottom right of your browser, click on the text at the bottom right (Mainnet, Pre-Prod, Preview, or Guild), and select the Preview option in the pop-up.
3. The Eternl extension reloads. The bottom right of your browser window now displays __Preview__.
4. Select __Add Wallet__ from the top left of your browser window. The Add Wallet pane displays.
5. Select the __Create Wallet__ button. The Password screen displays.
6. Enter a descriptive name for your wallet of between three and 40 characters in the __Wallet Name__ text field.
7. Enter a password of at least 12 characters in the __Enter Password__ text field.
{{<alert color="warning" title="Warning">}}You need this password when making a transaction. Even if this is a test wallet, securely store this password, so it doesn't get leaked and is not lost.{{</alert>}}
8. Enter the same password in the __Repeat Password__ text field.
9. Select the __Save__ button. Selecting the __Reset__ button clears all the text you have entered. The Account page displays.
10. Select the __Save__ button without making any changes in the Accounts page. The Hint page displays.

a single account, so we do not need to make any changes to the page before saving.{{</alert>}}

    2. Select the __Continue__ button.
    3. The 24 words that make up your recovery phrase display.

    2. Select the __Continue__ button.
    3. The Confirm page displays.
14. Enter the words from your recovery phrase in the text field. Ensure that you enter the words in order.
{{<alert title="Note">}}Eternl supplies suggestions as you type; when only a single word remains, press the Enter key to select it.{{</alert>}}
