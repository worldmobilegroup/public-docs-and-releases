You must add test ADA to your wallet so that you can fund transactions. To do so, complete the following steps:
1. In your browser, navigate to the [Cardano Testnets faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet/).
2. Scroll to the __Delegation__ section of the page.
3. If necessary, select __Preview Testnet__ from the __Environment__ drop-down menu.
4. If necessary, select __Receive test ADA__ from the __Action__ drop-down menu.
5. Enter the address of your wallet in the __Address__ text field.
{{<alert title="Note">}}You can find the address of your wallet in Eternl. 
To do this, select the wallet for which you want to find the address and select 
__Receive__ from the options at the top of the screen. Your available wallet addresses
are listed. For faucet, select the address ending in `'/0'/0/0`. This is also the
address that you send to World Mobile after you have set up your wallet;
it is the first address in the chain and identifies you. If it is not displayed at the
top of the screen, select the __Hide used/additional addresses__ toggle, and it is the
first address in the displayed list.{{</alert>}}
6. Select the __I'm not a robot__ checkbox.
7. Select the __REQUEST FUNDS__ button.

Test ADA will be received by your wallet.
