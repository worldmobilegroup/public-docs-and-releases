If you need to re-run the installation script, you must deregister your EarthNode, and then re-register it.

To deregister the EarthNode in the EarthNode Registration Manager, complete the following steps:
1. Select the ENNFT you want to disconnect.
2. Select __UnRegisterEarthNode__ form the __Select Transaction Type__ drop-down menu.
3. Select the __Build Transaction__ button. The Eternl transaction window displays.
4. Enter your Eternl password in the __Sign__ text box.
5. Select the __Sign__ button. When the transaction completes, a message displays in the EarthNode Registration Manager.
If successful, the transaction hash is included in the success message. If you select the transaction hash, you can view
the details of the transaction in a Cardano explorer, for example [Cexplorer](https://cexplorer.io).
